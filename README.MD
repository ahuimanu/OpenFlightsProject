#OpenFlights Project
* findlinks.py - a brief exercise in screen scraping - against terms of use, so for illustrative purposes only
* flightaware.py - uses the FlightXML2 REST API to obtain flight information.
* testdb.py - a brief example of connecting to MySQL using Python3 and PyMySQL

These examples should help you complete these tasks in Python.
